## Other Common Issues
For other common issues and their solutions, please check the Issues section of this repository.


## 🛠️ Getting Started

> Configuration requirements are in the utils/ folder.

### Linux Environment
1. Create a new environment using linux_environment.yml
```bash
# Note: Replace "MPE" with your preferred environment name
conda env create -f utils/linux_environment.yml -n MPE
# Activate the newly created environment
conda activate MPE
```
2. Install core dependencies with pip
```bash
pip install -r utils/pip-requirements.txt
```
### Mac M Series Chip Environment
1. Create a new environment using mac_arm_M4_environment.yml
```bash
# Note: Replace "MPE" with your preferred environment name
conda env create -f utils/mac_arm_M4_environment.yml -n MPE
# Activate the newly created environment
conda activate MPE
```
2. Install Mac M chip-specific dependencies
```bash
pip install -r utils/pip-requirements_mac_arm_M4.txt
```

### Windows Environment
1. Create and activate virtual environment (recommended)
```bash
# Note: Replace "MPE" with your preferred environment name
conda env create -f utils/conda-environment.yml -n MPE  
# Activate the newly created environment
conda activate MPE
```
2. Install core dependencies
```bash
pip install -r utils/pip-requirements.txt
```

### Other Prerequisites
> Then, install other prerequisites after creating new environment.
3. Install PyTorch
```bash
# Visit https://pytorch.org/ to select the appropriate installation command for your system
# For example:
pip3 install torch torchvision torchaudio
```
4. 2025.4.26 update: Install PettingZoo 1.25.0 version, the official PyPI repository has been updated to 1.25.0, with the same content as 1.24.4. MPE has been separated from PettingZoo, **warnings can be ignored**, see MPE2 for details: https://github.com/Farama-Foundation/MPE2
```bash
pip install pettingzoo==1.25.0
```
Alternatively, you can use the provided installation script to install PettingZoo 1.25.0:
```bash
python utils/setupPettingzoo.py
```

<!-- # ~~4. Install PettingZoo 1.24.4~~
# ~~Important: This project requires PettingZoo 1.24.4, but the official PyPI repository only offers version 1.24.3~~
# ~~You must install from GitHub source to get version 1.24.4 using:~~
# ~~pip install "pettingzoo[mpe] @ git+https://github.com/Farama-Foundation/PettingZoo.git"~~
# ~~Or, you can directly run the provided installation script:~~
# ~~python utils/setupPettingzoo.py~~ -->


### 🖥️ Runtime Configuration
> **Note:** The current version no longer depends on Visdom for visualization, but the related configuration is retained for reference if needed.

If you wish to use Visdom to visualize the training process, you can use the following commands:
```bash
# Start Visdom visualization server (in separate terminal)
python -m visdom.server
# or specify port
python -m visdom.server -port 8097

# Access training dashboard at:
# http://localhost:8097
```

## 🔄 Training Pipeline
1. **Parameter Customization**  
Configure environment parameters in [`main_parameter.py`](main_parameters.py)
``` bash
   env_name = 'simple_tag_v3'  # Options: simple_adversary_v3/ simple_spread_v3
   episode_num = 5000         # Total training episodes
   # Training parameters
   batch_size = 128          # Experience replay batch  size
   actor_lr = 0.01            # Actor network learning   rate
   critic_lr = 0.01           # Critic network learning  rate
```

2. **Start Visdom server**
```python
# Start Visdom visualization server (in separate terminal)
   python -m visdom.server
   or
   python -m visdom.server -port 8097

# Access training dashboard at:
# http://localhost:8097
```
3. **Run training script**:
```python
# Train with custom parameters
   python main_train.py
```
4. **Monitor training progress at `http://localhost:8097`**
5. **Evaluate trained models**
```python
   python main_evaluate.py
```

### 🌐 Environment Customization
The [`simple_tag_env.py`](envs/simple_tag_env.py) extends PettingZoo's MPE environment with:
- Custom agent dynamics in [`custom_agents_dynamics.py`](envs/custom_agents_dynamics.py)
- Modified reward functions optimized specifically for Predator-Prey pursuit tasks
- Adjustable agent physics parameters:
  - World size: 2.5 units (customizable for different pursuit scenarios)
  - Time step: 0.1s (affects action response time)
  - Damping coefficient: 0.2 (affects agent inertia)
  - Collision parameters:
    - Contact force: 1e2 (controls collision intensity, impacts capture effectiveness)
    - Contact margin: 1e-3 (controls collision softness)


## 📦 Data Management
### Model Storage
Trained models are automatically saved with timestamps:
```tree
./models/
└── maddpg_models/          # MADDPG checkpoint directory
    ├── {timestamp}_agent_0_actor.pth    # Actor network parameters
    ├── {timestamp}_agent_0_critic.pth   # Critic network parameters
    └── ...  
```
### Visualization Pipeline
```tree
plot/
├── data/                   # Serialized training metrics
│   └── plot_data_20240515.pkl  # PyTorch tensor storage
└── plot_rewards.py         # Visualization toolkit
```
### Logging System
Implemented in [logger.py](utils/logger.py) :
- Records training metadata (device, duration)
- Serializes hyperparameters
- Generates human-readable training reports

```tree
logs/
├── training_log.json       # Human-readable training report
└── plot_data_20240515.pkl  # Raw metrics for post-analysis
```
